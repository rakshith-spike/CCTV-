## 📌 Executive Summary

**FORENSIC-X (CamTrace)** is a unified multi-vendor DVR/NVR forensic analysis and AI-powered surveillance intelligence platform. It solves the critical bottleneck of proprietary CCTV/DVR file formats and fragmented evidence handling by providing standardized digital evidence acquisition (MD5 & SHA-256 cryptographic verification), automated video recovery, immutable chain-of-custody logging, and multimodal natural-language forensic search.

---

## ⚖️ Problem Statement & Solution

| Existing Issue | FORENSIC-X / CamTrace Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Proprietary & Diverse DVR/NVR Formats** | **Multi-Vendor Adapter Registry** for standardized logical acquisition across Hikvision, Dahua, CP Plus, and generic DVRs |
| **Manual CCTV Search Across Hours of Footage** | **Natural-Language Video Search** via multimodal semantic embeddings (CLIP + Qdrant) |
| **Chain-of-Custody & Tamper Risks** | **Dual Cryptographic Hashing (MD5 + SHA-256)** and auditable digital custody logs |
| **Unindexed & Hard-to-Track Events** | **Real-Time Detection & Spatio-Temporal Grouping** using YOLOv8, ByteTrack, and contextual clip generation |

### Innovation & Uniqueness
- **Searchable Visual Database:** Ingests raw CCTV feeds (MP4, MOV, AVI) and extracts dense visual-semantic representations.
- **Progressive Search Funnel:** Allows investigators to iteratively layer clues (color, object type, secondary attributes, zone entry) to narrow hundreds of candidates down to exact matches.
- **Natural-Language Understanding:** Query surveillance footage in plain English (e.g., *"Find a person wearing a red shirt and backpack entering through main gate"*).
- **Contextual Evidence Clips:** Automatically generates continuous, forensically verifiable video clips with preceding and succeeding temporal context via FFmpeg.

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Workflow & System Architecture

The CamTrace intelligence pipeline converts raw surveillance streams into forensically verified video evidence in six distinct phases:

```
[1. Load & Process Footage] ──► [2. Create Visual Database] ──► [3. Natural Language Search]
                                                                          │
[6. Contextual Evidence Clip] ◄── [5. Progressive Refinement] ◄── [4. Find & Rank Events]
```

### 1. Load & Process CCTV Footage
*Turn raw video into searchable visual data.*
- Ingests uploaded recordings or live RTSP streams (`MP4`, `MOV`, `AVI`).
- Executes adaptive frame sampling and fast sequential frame streaming.
- Runs **YOLOv8** for real-time person, vehicle, and object detection.
- Applies **ByteTrack** for persistent multi-object tracking and trajectory association across frames.

### 2. Create Visual Database
*Extract dense visual information from each detected entity.*
- Extracts bounding box crops for detected entities and full-scene frames.
- Generates 512-dimensional visual embeddings using **CLIP (ViT-B/32)**.
- Indexes vectors into **Qdrant Vector Database** alongside rich structured metadata:
  - Dominant color features (upper body, lower body, vehicle paint)
  - Entity category (`person`, `car`, `truck`, `backpack`, `handbag`, etc.)
  - Camera source identifier and camera zone coordinates
  - Absolute timestamps and continuous track IDs

### 3. Search Using Natural Language
*Describe what you remember — the system searches what happened.*
- Translates natural language descriptions into multimodal query vectors.
- Automatically parses structured filters:
  - **Entity Class:** Person, vehicle, bag
  - **Color Attributes:** Red, black, white, blue, etc.
  - **Scenario Constraints:** Restricted boundary crossings, entry/exit gates, dwell time

### 4. Find & Rank Matching Events
*Retrieve candidate events, not just isolated frames.*
- Performs cosine similarity search across high-dimensional vector space in Qdrant.
- Applies multi-signal ranking combining semantic similarity, attribute match scores, and rule verification.
- Returns candidate event clusters across multiple camera streams.

### 5. Refine the Search (Progressive Clue Funnel)
*Add details iteratively to eliminate false positives.*
- **Step 5.1:** Query `"Red shirt"` → *20 candidate events*
- **Step 5.2:** Add clue `"+ black pants"` → *8 candidate events*
- **Step 5.3:** Add clue `"+ backpack"` → *3 candidate events*
- **Step 5.4:** Add constraint `"Enters through main gate"` → *1–2 high-confidence matches*

### 6. Generate Contextual Evidence Clip
*From matching event to verified video evidence.*
- Performs temporal grouping of adjacent matching frames into continuous time windows.
- Automatically invokes **FFmpeg** to extract and re-encode a verified video clip with customizable before-and-after context (e.g., ±10 seconds).
- Provides instant HTTP Range streaming for continuous video playback, scrubbing, and forensic export.
